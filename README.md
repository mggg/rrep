# Race and Redistricting Expert Project

This is a supporting repo for the Race and Redistricting Expert Project, a training workshop run by Fred McBride and the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, AL in July 2024. 

This repo contains location-specific folders with shapefiles, election data, and other supporting materials.  They were prepared by Peter Horton and Spencer Nelson of the Redistricting Data Hub for use in this project.
